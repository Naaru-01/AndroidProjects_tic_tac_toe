# TIC TAC TOE GAME -ANDROID 
# XML | KOTLIN | FIREBASE | ANDROID STUDIO

>## PROJECT DESCRIPTION :

    Hey ! What’s up ! My Name’s Narayan, I am pursuing Computer Engineering .

  **-->**  Through this project I aimed to develop an android application using KOTLIN called tictoctoe.User can play in both SINGLE PLAYER and MULTIPLAYER mode and also in ONLINE MODE and OFFLINE MODE 
  
  **-->**   I have used Kotlin for developing this project.

  **-->**  Firebase is used as the database for online mode which stores GAME CODE for each match and after math ends it is deleted from the Firebase real time database.



I experienced myself very bold, happy and innovative while working on this project.
I think and hope , All the users would like this system ! shouldn’t it ?
